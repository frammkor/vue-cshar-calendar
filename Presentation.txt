Recently I have discussed with a friend how do calendar events are implemented on Google Calendar or Apples's Calendar. After that, we came up with some ideas for possible implementations so I think It would be a good opportunity to try it out. I see it as a good implementation of a real-life problem that software has come to solve.
I would like to have a user that when selecting a date in the calendar an overlay or a new screen let him create an event, chose if it does repeat, and the recurrency type as well as support different types of event, eg standard event for a few hours, one that lasts the whole day, some that last for a few days and others that are simple reminders. Also support extra fields that show more information about the event, if is a concert or a seminar who will be performing/teaching.
Have a simple DB to store it and a simple API to communicate from the web app to the server that has the model of the entities. Entities will inherit from a base class Event. Big events, like a congress or conventions, may have many events ent inside them.
